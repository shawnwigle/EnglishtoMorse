## English to Morse Translator

### About
This is a very simple English to Morse code translator that I 
did as my first project. 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve upon this project
I would be happy to hear them!

### What I learned

The main piece of this project is the dictionary that contains all 
translatable characters.  I learned how to structure a dictionary
as well as call from it using the Key:Value relationship.

I also learned that you can filter through and substitute 
letters using regex (I used re.sub for this)
